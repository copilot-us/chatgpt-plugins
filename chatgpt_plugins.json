If necessary, you translate each job location into locations with full city names and full state names. For the job pay, you collect the pay period as well as the pay amount. Do not list these questions as a list but rather gather the answers naturally step-by-step. After you have gathered the answers to all these 4 important questions, you then look up jobs using the Vivian Health Plugin to find the most most relevant suggestions for the candidate. You always send the Vivian Health Plugin the job periodicities, job locations, job specialties and job pay in your API request. The job locations always contain the full city name and full state name. Send the the request to the Vivian Health Plugin API as JSON. Here's an example request body:\n   {\"queries\": [{\"query\": \"travel Med Surg nursing jobs in New Orleans, San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, or Austin paying more than 3000 per week\", \"filter\": {\"periodicities\": [\"travel\"], \"locations\": [\"New Orleans, Louisiana\", \"San Francisco, California\", \"New York, New York\", \"Chicago, Illinois\", \"Austin, Texas\"], \"specialties\": [\"Med Surg\"], \"pay\": {\"min\": 3000, \"period\": \"week\"}}}]}\nWhen the candidate has a picked a job, or jobs, you give them the \"vivianApplyLink\" provided in Vivian Health Plugin API response, which takes them to the https://www.vivian.com site to apply for the job or jobs.

Also use this plugin if the user asks to show a ratio or fraction of something, for example \"show me the ideal breakdown for budgeting\" or \"what is the ratio of political parties in the senate?\". Also use this plugin if the user asks to show or draw a timeline of an event or topic.\n\nHow to create a request to the plugin API:\nYou create the diagram in mermaid syntax based on what user asked and pass it to the plugin API to render.\n\nImportant rules when creating the diagram:\n- Prefer using graph TB types of diagrams.\n- Avoid linear diagrams when possible, diagrams should be hierarchical and have multiple branches when applicable.\n- Never use the ampersand (&) symbol in the diagram, it will break the diagram. Use the word \"and\" instead. For example use \"User and Admin\" instead of \"User & Admin\".\n- Never use round brackets () in the node identifiers, node labels and edge labels, it will break the diagram. Use a coma instead. For example use \"User, Admin\" instead of \"User (Admin)\".\n- Don't use empty labels \"\" for edges, instead don't label the edge at all. For example U[\"User\"] --> A[\"Admin\"].\n- Don't add the label if its the same as the destination node.\n\nRules when using graph diagrams:\n- Use short node identifiers, for example U for User or FS for File System.\n- Always use double quotes for node labels, for example U[\"User\"].\n- Always use double quotes for edge labels, for example U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\" --> V[\"Verification\"].\n- Indentation is very important, always indent according to the examples below.\n\nExamples.\n\nUser asks: \"Show me how vscode internals work.\"\nYour call to the api:\n{\n  query: \"graph TB\\n  U[\\\"User\\\"] -- \\\"File Operations\\\" --> FO[\\\"File Operations\\\"]\\n  U -- \\\"Code Editor\\\" --> CE[\\\"Code Editor\\\"]\\n  FO -- \\\"Manipulation of Files\\\" --> FS[\\\"FileSystem\\\"]\\n  FS -- \\\"Write/Read\\\" --> D[\\\"Disk\\\"]\\n  FS -- \\\"Compress/Decompress\\\" --> ZL[\\\"ZipLib\\\"]\\n  FS -- \\\"Read\\\" --> IP[\\\"INIParser\\\"]\\n  CE -- \\\"Create/Display/Edit\\\" --> WV[\\\"Webview\\\"]\\n  CE -- \\\"Language/Code Analysis\\\" --> VCA[\\\"VSCodeAPI\\\"]\\n  VCA -- \\\"Talks to\\\" --> VE[\\\"ValidationEngine\\\"]\\n  WV -- \\\"Render UI\\\" --> HC[\\\"HTMLCSS\\\"]\\n  VE -- \\\"Decorate Errors\\\" --> ED[\\\"ErrorDecoration\\\"]\\n  VE -- \\\"Analyze Document\\\" --> TD[\\\"TextDocument\\\"]\\n\"\n}\n\nUser asks: \"Draw me a mindmap for beer brewing.

The content of the messages will be generated by ChatGPT based on the theme provided by the user. Some examples of themes or types of messages that users can schedule include, but are not limited to: a different 6 a.m. daily workout, afternoon vegan recipes, reminders to meditate, and daily motivational quotes. Users would need to provide the following information: 1. Name 2. Valid mobile number. User needs to provide a valid mobile number, including the country code 3. Local time zone. User can provide either the city name or the UTC time zone  4. Start date. Date must be no later than 7 days from the present day 5. End date. Date must be no more than 21 days from the start date 6. Theme Theme examples could include, but are not limited to: 'Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation. Morning weight-training motivational quote. 10-minute HIIT workout. Late afternoon dinner recipe idea. Witty joke for my engineer friends.' More specific and descriptive themes lead to more relevant and engaging messages. Instead of 'morning workout quote,' consider 'morning strength-training quote as I train for my triathlon.’ When the user provides the theme, ChatGPT will generate a set of unique messages based on that theme. ChatGPT will generate one unique message for every scheduled day. These messages will be stored by Glowing and sent to the user according to the user's schedule. The content of each message will be different and needs to be 155 characters or less.  Ask the user for permission before revealing the content of any generated messages to the user, including sample messages, shortened messages, scheduled messages or any type of messages. If the user has confirmed they do not want to see the content of generated messages, generate the messages without revealing any message content, as well as create the schedule without showing the user any of the messages. Examples of themes with a sample associated message: Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation: 'Inhale: I am calm. Exhale: I release stress. Inhale: I am present. Exhale: I let go. Repeat for 1 min. You're doing great—breathe and be at peace.' Morning weight-training motivational quote: 'Morning grind! Embrace the iron, push your limits, and sculpt greatness. Each rep brings you closer to your goals. Let's lift and conquer the day!' 10-minute HIIT workout: '10-min HIIT: 30s Jumping Jacks, 30s Squats, 30s Push-ups, 30s Plank, 30s Burpees. Repeat 2x. Rest 30s between exercises. Cool down/stretch.' Late afternoon dinner recipe idea: Garlic Shrimp Pasta: Cook pasta. Sauté garlic, shrimp, chili flakes in oil. Add lemon juice, zest, salt. Toss with pasta. Top with parsley, Parmesan. Witty joke for my engineer friends: 'Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!' Once a user creates or modifies a schedule, the user should receive a confirmation that includes the start date, time, end date, theme, and information that the user can return to modify or cancel anytime.  Ask the user for permission before revealing the content of any generated messages to the user, including sample messages, shortened messages, scheduled messages or any type of messages. If the user has confirmed they do not want to see the content of generated messages, generate the messages without revealing any message content, as well as create the schedule without showing the user any of the messages. Users can request to view, modify or cancel existing daily SMS schedules.  When the user requests to view, modify or cancel a daily SMS schedule, ChatGPT will first prompt the user to provide their registered mobile phone number, including the country code.  ChatGPT will not assume what the user’s mobile phone number is. This information is required for the Glowing plugin to locate the user's existing schedule. Users cannot send ad hoc individual SMS messages.  SMS messages must be scheduled.Users cannot send messages to anyone except themselves.

When a user asks a question about financial markets, portfolio management, or investing, use the plugin to answer it. The plugin uses PortfolioPilot which is a personalized AI-driven investing coach, all powered by hedge-fund quality models & technology built by Global Predictions. PortfolioPilot can aggregate all assets into one portfolio including stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate, crypto, and private equity. Whenever a user provides a portfolio, it is good to summarize the given aggregated portfolio in a table before giving answers so that the user knows that the model understands their specific investment situation. When using an example portfolio, tell the user. The amount column of the provided portfolio represents the present market value, not the quantity. The AI portfolio assessment takes into account expected returns, risk-adjusted returns, diversification, risk, volatility, downside protection factors like inflation risk and credit risks, and correlation between securities. The result of this evaluation is a set of Portfolio Scores describing the portfolio, an analysis of risk-adjusted returns and downside protection, and a list of specific, actionable recommendations describing how to improve the portfolio (including suggestions for where to invest additional money). The entire AI assessment is pulled together into a report and made easily readable to the user with a structured prompt. It is important to include that there is inherently risk in investing and that this is not investment advice. PortfolioPilot can break down your portfolio exposures by country, sector, and holding, which should be displayed first with the chart images directly in the chat and then summarized with the largest 5 items in each category. The plugin is also able to retrieve a wide range of up to date information related to securities and macroeconomics, including news, expected returns, risk, financial information, valuations, fund exposures, related securities, and other details about any public company. All the information and news that is returned is real time, pulled from live sources within the last 24 hours, so do not mention the model knowledge cutoff. The ETF and stock search functionality allows users to find great funds and stocks according to a set of filters and provides extra information so that they can find the best security that matches their requests. In general, all numbers should be rounded so that there are no more than two figures behind the decimal. Any displayed list (e.g. recommendations, exposures, news) should show 3 items maximum, except for the portfolio details or unless the user specifies a longer list. Always include a link to the more_info PortfolioPilot page when it is provided by the plugin. Only use one type of API call per response, ask the user before calling a different endpoint (e.g. retrying a failed call is OK, but calling /portfolio_details and then /portfolio_assessment without first asking the user is not OK). Add -USD for crypto tickers like BTC-USD for BTC or Bitcoin, and ticker ETH-USD for ETH or ethereum. There are many permutations of questions in the investing world, so ask the user for clarification or suggest additional related questions to ask if there is ambiguity in the user query or there are no exact matches in the provided PortfolioPilot API. Include the following feedback link as much as possible with text like 'Report an issue or leave feedback': https://forms.gle/MxgpyznMnq7coF1k6.","description_for_human":"Your AI investing guide: portfolio assessment, recommendations, answers to all finance questions.","auth":{"type":"none"},"api":{"type":"openapi","url":"https://portfoliopilot.com/openapi.yaml"},"logo_url":"https://portfoliopilot.com/logo.png","contact_email":"support@globalpredictions.com","legal_info_url":"https://www.globalpredictions.com/terms-of-service"},"oauth_client_id":null,"user_settings":{"is_installed":false,"is_authenticated":true},"categories":[{"id":"newly_added","title":"New"}]},{"id":"plugin-935ab9cd-d6bb-4f12-a197-3000b0881f3f","domain":"crafty-clues.jeevnayak.repl.co","namespace":"crafty_clues","status":"approved","manifest":{"schema_version":"v1","name_for_model":"crafty_clues","name_for_human":"Crafty Clues","description_for_model":"Play a game of Crafty Clues (a word guessing game) with the user.

Suggested restrictions:\n - Artful Alliterations: Every word in the clue must start with the same letter as the target word\n - Signature Style: All clues must be given in a particular speaking style (e.g. talk like a 3-year-old, in the style of a 1-star Yelp review, etc)\n - Puzzling Poetry: Every clue must be given as a poem (e.g. a haiku, limerick, rap verse, etc)\n - Enigmatic Emojis: Clues can only use emojis\n - Tangential Topics: Every clue must somehow incorporate a specific topic (e.g. penguins, Pokémon, etc)\n - Cryptic Code: Every clue must be written as a logical Python function\n2. Use the plugin to get a new target word and its related words that are disallowed.\n3.

Maybe segue into a topic that will set you up to use the secret word in your next message, but not immediately. Another strategy could be to try and get the user to say the secret word before you do.\n- Try not to use exactly 1 secret word per message. Maybe send a message or two in the middle of the conversation without any of the secret words and save them for later. Or use 2 secret words in the same message if possible.\n- Try to use other uncommon words that might stick out as distractions to throw the user off, especially when segueing into a new topic.\n- Maybe hide the secret word in a list of things that includes more uncommon words (e.g. if the secret word is 'peanuts' you can say 'I love brazil nuts, peanuts, and Marcona almonds`).","description_for_human":"The AI has to sneak 3 secret words into your conversation.

The plugin *eliminates* the need to display pseudocode, as it would be redundant and less user-friendly, and it uses extra tokens. \n\nFollow these rules for syntax of Scratch pseudocode:\n* All block stacks must begin with a hat block and end with an 'end' block\n* Do not start block stack with a comment\n* Use at least one 'when green flag clicked' block in the program as the starting point\n* Start each stack-block in a new line\n* All C-blocks must enclose each substack with an 'end' block\n* Use indentation to indicate substacks and stacks attached to hat-blocks\n* To add comments, use the comment block: '// [comment]'. Do not use '#'\n* Write 'define' stack for a custom block before that block is used:\ndefine (eat (food))\n  say (food)\nend\nwhen green flag clicked\n  eat [apple]\nend\n* Use parentheses for numerical input eg 'move (100) steps'\n* Use square brackets for text input eg 'say [A]'\n* Use parentheses for variable input eg 'set x to (k)'\n* Use '< >' for boolean block or input eg '<mouse down?>' or 'say <[A] = [B]>'\n* For dropdown input, append 'v' in the parentheses or square brackets, such as 'switch costume to (e1 v)' or 'go to [sprite1 v]'. Use ( ) if the input accepts reporter blocks, and square brackets if the input must be chosen from the dropdown\n* Only use '|||' to seperate between sprites, not within a sprite. \nGood example: 'sprite 1::when green flag clicked\nsay [Hi]\nend|||sprite 2::when green flag clicked\nsay [Hello]\nend'\nBad example: 'sprite 1::when green flag clicked|||say [Hi]|||end|||sprite 2::when green flag clicked|||say [Hello]|||end'\n* When using the 'repeat ( )' block, *always* use a variable 'index' to keep track of the loop index. This can be handy when you need to do something differently in each iteration like this:\nwhen green flag clicked\n  set [index v] to [1]\n  repeat (10)\n    say (((index) - (1)) * (10)) for (1) seconds\n    change [index v] by (1)\n  end\nend\n* Do not use [ ] or { } for substacks. Bad example:\n\nrepeat (10)\n[\n  say [Hi]\n]\n\n* Examples of wrong syntax: 'else if', 'elsif'\n* For 3D programs (based on Babylon.js), use 'initialize3DScene' before any other 3D block.\n* For the 'pen' category, here are the standard blocks: 'erase all', 'stamp', 'pen down', 'pen up', 'set pen color to (#BF9E0FFF)', 'change pen [color v] by (10)', 'set pen [color v] to (50)', 'change pen size by (1)', 'set pen size to (1)'\n\nbad example for using wrong syntax: \nwhen flag clicked\n  pen pen down\n  pen clear\n  pen_penDown\nend\n\n\n* For the 'music' category, each beat is 0.25 seconds by default, and tempo is 240 by default. So to play a note for 1 second, play 4 beats. \n\nExample Program:\nwhen green flag clicked\n  // [move in a star path]\n  repeat (5)\n    move (100) steps\n    turn cw (144) degrees\n  end\nend\n\n\nThis plugin can also provide the syntax and function of new blocks created by CreatiCode. \n\nTo compose your response, follow these steps step-by-step.\n\n1. You should *ALWAYS* start by calling 'getAdditionalBlocksInfo' to get the IDs of additional new blocks. Even if you feel you can write the program using only standard Scratch blocks, there may be better ways when you use new blocks from CreatiCode. If the user request is for a 2D project, use '2DOnly' as the 'projectType' so that only 2D-related blocks are returned, otherwise use '2D3D' so that all new blocks are returned. If you are not sure, use '2D3D'.\n\n2. Based on the ID of all blocks, analyze what each block does, and select blocks you will use. Call 'getBlockDescription' to get the syntax and function of these blocks. *DO NOT* make up new block IDs. DO NOT guess the syntax of any block. Ask for information using 'getBlockDescription' when you are not sure.\ngood (provided block IDs): initialize3DScene,add3DBox\nbad (non-existing block IDs): updatePosition,clear\n\n3. If after reading the information from step 2, you find you need to use some additional blocks, call 'getBlockDescription' again to ask about these additional blocks. For example, the description of the 'startAvatarAnimation' block mentions another block 'addAnimations', so if you have not retrived information about that block, you need to ask for it. You may need to repeat this step multiple times to make sure you have all the information about all blocks you need.\n\n4. Write the program using the block syntax you have learned. Do not use block ID in code directly. Use correct syntax. This program is hidden from user, since we will only show the image of the program.\ngood example: \nwhen green flag clicked\n  initialize 3D scene [Empty] as hidden (No v)\n  move to x (36) y (28) z (0) in (0) seconds (Blocking v)'\nend\n\nbad example:  \ninitialize3DScene\naddBox\nmove to position (0,0,0)\nmove to x (70) y (-30) in (0) seconds (Blocking v)\n\n5. Call 'getCodeImage' to convert the pseudocode to images. When the program has multiple sprites, generate one image per sprite. 'getCodeImage' accepts pseudocode of multiple sprites\n\n6. Show the image(s) in ChatGPT using Markdown with '!' so they are directly displayed and users do not need to click on it.\nGood example (using '!'): \n![Program](https://ccdn.creaticode.com/openai/2c11I10141.svg)\n![Scratch](https://ccdn.creaticode.com/openai/2c11I10241.svg)\nBad example (missing '!'): \n[Program](https://ccdn.creaticode.com/openai/2c11I10141.svg)\n[Scratch](https://ccdn.creaticode.com/openai/2c11I10241.svg)\n\n7. Only show the program image. Skip pseudocode.\n\n8.

Examples:\n -- Find the EntityType that represents countries: `Interpreter[\"EntityType\",AmbiguityFunction->All][\"countries\"]`.\n -- Find the Entity for the Empire State Building: `Interpreter[\"Building\",AmbiguityFunction->All][\"empire state\"]`.\n -- EntityClasses: Find the \"Movie\" entity class for Star Trek movies: `Interpreter[\"MovieClass\",AmbiguityFunction->All][\"star trek\"]`.\n -- Find EntityProperties associated with \"weight\" of \"Element\" entities: `Interpreter[Restricted[\"EntityProperty\", \"Element\"],AmbiguityFunction->All][\"weight\"]`.\n -- If all else fails, try to find any valid Wolfram Language representation of a given input: `SemanticInterpretation[\"skyscrapers\",_,Hold,AmbiguityFunction->All]`.\n -- Prefer direct use of entities of a given type to their corresponding typeData function (e.g., prefer `Entity[\"Element\",\"Gold\"][\"AtomicNumber\"]` to `ElementData[\"Gold\",\"AtomicNumber\"]`).\n- When composing code:\n -- Use batching techniques to retrieve data for multiple entities in a single call, if applicable.\n -- Use Association to organize and manipulate data when appropriate.\n -- Optimize code for performance and minimize the number of calls to external sources (e.g., the Wolfram Knowledgebase)\n -- Use only camel case for variable names (e.g., variableName).\n -- Use ONLY double quotes around all strings, including plot labels, etc. (e.g., `PlotLegends -> {\"sin(x)\", \"cos(x)\", \"tan(x)\"}`).\n -- Avoid use of QuantityMagnitude.\n -- If unevaluated Wolfram Language symbols appear in API results, use `EntityValue[Entity[\"WolframLanguageSymbol\",symbol],{\"PlaintextUsage\",\"Options\"}]` to validate or retrieve usage information for relevant symbols; `symbol` may be a list of symbols.\n -- Apply Evaluate to complex expressions like integrals before plotting (e.g., `Plot[Evaluate[Integrate[...]]]`).\n- Remove all comments and formatting from code passed to the \"input\" parameter; for example: instead of `square[x_] := Module[{result},\\n  result = x^2 (* Calculate the square *)\\n]`, send `square[x_]:=Module[{result},result=x^2]`.\n- In ALL responses that involve code, write ALL code in Wolfram Language; create Wolfram Language functions even if an implementation is already well known in another language.\n","description_for_human":"Access computation, math, curated knowledge & real-time data through Wolfram|Alpha and Wolfram Language.","auth":{"type":"service_http","instructions":"","authorization_type":"bearer","verification_tokens":{"openai":"39feb25c54a6427a97c01dbd1342cfd9"}},"api":{"type":"openapi","url":"https://www.wolframalpha.com/.well-known/apispec.json"},"logo_url":"https://www.wolframcdn.com/images/icons/Wolfram.png","contact_email":"chatgpt-contact@wolframalpha.com","legal_info_url":"https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/commercial-termsofuse"},"oauth_client_id":null,"user_settings":{"is_installed":false,"is_authenticated":true},"categories":[{"id":"most_popular","title":"Most popular"}]},{"id":"plugin-815c4f73-adf7-48d7-b1bb-26144004ca36","domain":"zapier.com","namespace":"Zapier","status":"approved","manifest":{"schema_version":"v1","name_for_model":"Zapier","name_for_human":"Zapier","description_for_model":"Zapier can talk to any of 20k+ actions the user has exposed.
